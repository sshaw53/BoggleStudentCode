| Jan 6  |   1-1:45pm    |                                                                                                                         In class, I tried to find a way to successfully and efficiently go through the Boggle board. I think I'm going to use BFS and a TST, but not entirely sure yet. |
| Jan 8  | 11:15-11:55am | In class, we learned about how to use DFS with recursion, so now I am going with that approach. I also decided to use a Trie instead of a TST because I thought it would be easy to check for prefixes and since our alphabet we're working with is of size 26, we save a lot of space. |
| Jan 8  |   6:40-7pm    |                                                                                                                                          Added some code, still struggling to figure out how to look to see if each word is a valid prefix and how to make my algorithm work correctly. |
| Jan 10 |  9:05-9:55am  |                                                                               I switched back to a TST since it has faster retrievals since it saves space - I had my TST lookup function return the found node instead of a boolean. I passed small checks but my runtime is too long. |
| Jan 10 |  1:50-2:20pm  |                                                         I talked with Mr. Blick and realized that I needed to call the lookup() function less, and I could save a lot of time by creating a second lookup function to get from a prefix to adding the next letter. I passed all checks! |
