I think I'm going to use BFS and a TST, but not entirely sure yet. |
| Jan 8 | 11:15-11:55am | In class, we learned about how to use DFS with recursion, so now I am going with that approach. I also decided to use a Trie instead of a TST because I thought it would be easy to check for prefixes and since our alphabet we're working with is of size 26, we save a lot of space. |
